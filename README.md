**Technologies Used** <br>
HTML<br>
CSS<br>
JavaScript<br>

<h3>Brief</h3>
The brief for this project was to create a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game had to be built with a defined win/lose condition and separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specific requirements included:

Render a game in the browser
Use a grid system (no HTML Canvas)
Design logic for winning and visually display the winner
Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
Follow KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
Deploy the game online
Use semantic markup and CSS best practices

<h3>Planning</h3>
<h4> Wireframe </h4>

During the planning phase, I created a wireframe to visualise the game's layout and structure. The wireframe included the game board, score display, controls, time left , the music features and a game over/restart screen.
